# ACCELERATED 3-DAY GAME PLAN
## Campaign Dashboard - Fast Track to Excellence

---

## ⏱️ **REALITY CHECK: 70 Hours = 3 Days**

**Available Time Breakdown:**
- Thursday: 8-10 coding hours
- Friday: 8-10 coding hours  
- Saturday: 8-10 coding hours
- **Total: 24-30 productive hours**

**Our Plan: 11-12 hours of focused work**
**Buffer: 12-18 hours** ✅

**YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME!** 🎉

---

## 🎯 **ACCELERATED STRATEGY**

### **Key Insight:**
You don't need to build everything perfectly. You need to:
1. ✅ Meet all requirements
2. ✅ Show senior-level thinking
3. ✅ Have solid code quality
4. ✅ Finish with confidence

### **Speed Optimizations:**
- Copy code from guides (don't reinvent)
- Test as you go (catch bugs early)
- Skip some tests if needed (aim for 60-70% vs 80%+)
- Good styling, not perfect styling
- Focus on working > perfect

## ⚡ **SPEED TACTICS**

### **What to Copy/Paste from Guides:**
✅ **Validators.js** - Copy entirely from guide
✅ **Calculations.js** - Copy entirely from guide
✅ **Formatters.js** - Copy entirely from guide
✅ **Redux slices** - Copy and adapt from guide
✅ **Service layer** - Copy structure from guide

### **What to Build Fresh:**
🔨 **Components** - Simple, based on guide examples
🔨 **Pages** - Wire up components with Redux
🔨 **CSS** - Clean and professional, not fancy
🔨 **Tests** - Key functions only, skip some component tests

### **What to Skip/Minimize:**
⏭️ **Perfect test coverage** - Aim for 60-70%, not 80%+
⏭️ **Every edge case test** - Test happy path + major errors
⏭️ **Fancy animations** - Keep it clean and simple
⏭️ **Toast notifications** - Error banner is enough
⏭️ **Loading skeletons** - Simple spinner is fine

## 💡 **SPEED CODING TIPS**

### **Copy Smart:**
```bash
# Don't reinvent the wheel
1. Open guide
2. Copy code block
3. Paste into file
4. Adapt if needed
5. Test immediately
```

### **Test as You Go:**
```bash
# Don't save testing for later
After each file:
  npm test <filename>
  
If tests fail:
  Fix immediately (5 min max)
  Move on if stuck
```

### **Commit Often:**
```bash
# Every 30-60 minutes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add X"

# If something breaks, you can roll back
```

### **Use Placeholders:**
```javascript
// Don't get stuck on perfect styling
const styles = {
  card: 'bg-white p-4 rounded shadow'
}

// Come back to polish later
```
