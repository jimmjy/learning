# Data Persistence Analysis: Campaign Switching

**Problem:** When switching campaigns, all accumulated dashboard data is lost.

---

## üîç The Problem

### Current State Structure:
```javascript
{
  campaigns: {
    list: [...],
    selectedCampaignId: 1,
    dashboardData: {              // ‚ùå Single storage location
      totals: { ... },
      recent: { ... },
      iteration: 2
    }
  }
}
```

### What Happens:
```
1. View Campaign #1
   - Accumulate data over 10 iterations
   - totals: { impressions: 50000, clicks: 2500, users: 15000 }
   - iteration: 10

2. Switch to Campaign #2
   - selectCampaign(2) resets dashboardData
   - Start fresh: iteration = 0, totals = {0, 0, 0}

3. Switch back to Campaign #1
   - All previous data LOST! 
   - Must start over from iteration 0
   - User sees: 0 impressions (was 50,000)
```

## üí° Solution 1: Simple (Keep Current Approach)

### Philosophy:
"Each campaign view is a fresh session. Past data doesn't matter."

### Implementation:
**No changes needed!** Current code already does this.

### Pros:
‚úÖ Simple to implement (already done)
‚úÖ No complex state management
‚úÖ Predictable behavior
‚úÖ Lower memory usage
‚úÖ No cache invalidation concerns

### Cons:
‚ùå Poor UX when switching between campaigns
‚ùå Lose historical context
‚ùå Must wait for data to accumulate again
‚ùå Feels "broken" to users

### When to Use:
- Very simple dashboard
- Users rarely switch campaigns
- Real-time data only matters
- Limited resources/time

---

## üí° Solution 2: Per-Campaign Storage (Better UX)

### Philosophy:
"Each campaign remembers its own accumulated data."

### New State Structure:
```javascript
{
  campaigns: {
    list: [...],
    selectedCampaignId: 1,
    dashboardDataByID: {              // ‚úÖ Store per campaign!
      1: {                            // Campaign #1's data
        totals: { impressions: 50000, clicks: 2500, users: 15000 },
        recent: { impressions: 4500, clicks: 225, users: 1350 },
        iteration: 10,
        lastSuccessfulFetch: "2025-10-02T10:00:50Z"
      },
      2: {                            // Campaign #2's data
        totals: { impressions: 30000, clicks: 1500, users: 9000 },
        recent: { impressions: 3000, clicks: 150, users: 900 },
        iteration: 6,
        lastSuccessfulFetch: "2025-10-02T10:00:30Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Flow Example:
```
1. View Campaign #1
   - Fetch iteration 0, 1, 2, ..., 10
   - dashboardDataByID[1] accumulates data
   - totals: 50000 impressions

2. Switch to Campaign #2
   - dashboardDataByID[1] stays intact! ‚úÖ
   - Create/load dashboardDataByID[2]
   - Start from iteration 0 for Campaign #2

3. Switch back to Campaign #1
   - dashboardDataByID[1] still there! ‚úÖ
   - Resume from iteration 11 (continue where left off)
   - OR start fresh (your choice)
```

### Implementation Changes:

#### 1. Redux Slice Changes:
```javascript
// campaignsSlice.js

const initialState = {
  list: [],
  selectedCampaignId: null,
  dashboardDataByID: {},  // ‚úÖ Changed: Store per ID
  isLoading: false,
  error: null,
  isAutoRefreshPaused: false
};

// Helper to get or create dashboard data for a campaign
const getDashboardData = (state, campaignId) => {
  if (!state.dashboardDataByID[campaignId]) {
    state.dashboardDataByID[campaignId] = {
      totals: { impressions: 0, clicks: 0, users: 0 },
      recent: null,
      iteration: 0,
      lastSuccessfulFetch: null
    };
  }
  return state.dashboardDataByID[campaignId];
};

const campaignsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'campaigns',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    selectCampaign: (state, action) => {
      state.selectedCampaignId = action.payload;
      // ‚úÖ Create entry if doesn't exist, but DON'T reset existing data
      getDashboardData(state, action.payload);
      state.error = null;
      state.isAutoRefreshPaused = false;
    }
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(loadMetrics.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        const campaignId = action.meta.arg.campaignId;
        const dashboardData = getDashboardData(state, campaignId);
        
        // ‚úÖ Accumulate data for THIS campaign only
        dashboardData.totals.impressions += action.payload.impressions;
        dashboardData.totals.clicks += action.payload.clicks;
        dashboardData.totals.users += action.payload.users;
        dashboardData.recent = action.payload;
        dashboardData.iteration += 1;
        dashboardData.lastSuccessfulFetch = new Date().toISOString();
        
        state.isLoading = false;
        state.error = null;
      });
  }
});
```

#### 2. Selector Changes:
```javascript
// Before (single dashboard data)
export const selectDashboardData = (state) => state.campaigns.dashboardData;

// After (per-campaign data)
export const selectDashboardData = (state) => {
  const campaignId = state.campaigns.selectedCampaignId;
  if (!campaignId) return null;
  return state.campaigns.dashboardDataByID[campaignId] || null;
};

// Totals selector works the same (uses selectDashboardData)
export const selectTotals = createSelector(
  [selectDashboardData],
  (dashboardData) => dashboardData?.totals || { impressions: 0, clicks: 0, users: 0 }
);

// All other selectors remain unchanged!
```

#### 3. Component Changes:
```javascript
// DashboardPage.jsx - NO CHANGES NEEDED!
// Components use selectors, selectors handle the per-ID lookup

const DashboardPage = () => {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  
  // ‚úÖ Works the same - selectors handle the complexity
  const totals = useSelector(selectTotals);
  const recent = useSelector(selectRecent);
  
  // Rest of component unchanged...
};
```

### Pros:
‚úÖ Better UX - switching campaigns preserves data
‚úÖ Can resume where left off
‚úÖ Feels more professional
‚úÖ Users can compare campaigns by switching
‚úÖ Minimal component changes (only Redux slice)

### Cons:
‚ùå Slightly more complex state management
‚ùå Higher memory usage (stores data for all viewed campaigns)
‚ùå Need to handle stale data (optional: add timestamps/TTL)
‚ùå More Redux code

## üéØ Recommendation

### For Your Project: **Solution 2** (Per-Campaign Storage)

**Why:**
1. **Better UX** - Professional dashboards preserve state
2. **Resume capability** - Can continue from where you left off
3. **Not much harder** - Only Redux changes, components stay same
4. **Shows skill** - Demonstrates understanding of complex state management

### Decision Factors:

```
Choose Solution 1 (Simple) if:
‚ùå Very limited time (<2 hours left)
‚ùå Just need basic functionality
‚ùå Users will never switch campaigns
‚ùå Memory is severely constrained

Choose Solution 2 (Better) if:
‚úÖ Want professional polish
‚úÖ Have 2-4 hours for implementation
‚úÖ Users will switch between campaigns
‚úÖ Want to showcase Redux skills
```

---

## üîÑ Optional Enhancement: Resume vs. Restart

With Solution 2, you can choose:

### Option A: Resume (Continue Accumulating)
```javascript
// Switch back to Campaign #1
// Continue from iteration 11, 12, 13...
// Keeps accumulating totals
```

**Pros:** Never lose progress
**Cons:** Data might get very stale if campaign inactive for long time

### Option B: Restart (Fresh Start)
```javascript
selectCampaign: (state, action) => {
  state.selectedCampaignId = action.payload;
  // ‚úÖ Always start fresh when switching
  state.dashboardDataByID[action.payload] = {
    totals: { impressions: 0, clicks: 0, users: 0 },
    recent: null,
    iteration: 0
  };
}
```

**Pros:** Always fresh data
**Cons:** Same as Solution 1 (lose data on switch)

### Option C: Hybrid (Best of Both)
```javascript
// Keep data for 5 minutes after leaving a campaign
// If you return within 5 min ‚Üí Resume
// If you return after 5 min ‚Üí Restart

const CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes

selectCampaign: (state, action) => {
  const campaignId = action.payload;
  state.selectedCampaignId = campaignId;
  
  const existing = state.dashboardDataByID[campaignId];
  const now = new Date().getTime();
  const lastFetch = existing?.lastSuccessfulFetch 
    ? new Date(existing.lastSuccessfulFetch).getTime()
    : 0;
  
  // ‚úÖ If data is fresh (< 5 min old), keep it
  // ‚ùå If data is stale (> 5 min old), reset
  if (!existing || (now - lastFetch > CACHE_TTL)) {
    state.dashboardDataByID[campaignId] = {
      totals: { impressions: 0, clicks: 0, users: 0 },
      recent: null,
      iteration: 0,
      lastSuccessfulFetch: null
    };
  }
}
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (Resume), add Option C (TTL) if you have time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan (Solution 2)

### Step 1: Update Redux Slice (30 min)
1. Change `dashboardData` ‚Üí `dashboardDataByID`
2. Add `getDashboardData` helper
3. Update all reducers to use per-ID storage
4. Update `selectCampaign` to not reset data

### Step 2: Update Selectors (15 min)
1. Modify `selectDashboardData` to lookup by ID
2. Test that all other selectors still work

### Step 3: Test (30 min)
1. Switch between campaigns
2. Verify data persists
3. Verify auto-refresh still works
4. Verify error handling still works

### Step 4: Optional Enhancements (30 min)
1. Add TTL/stale data handling
2. Add "Clear cached data" button
3. Add "Last updated X ago" per campaign

**Total Time:** 1.5-2 hours

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Implement Solution 2** for these reasons:

1. **Your observation shows maturity** - You spotted a real UX issue
2. **It's not that hard** - Mostly Redux changes, minimal component impact
3. **Huge UX improvement** - Makes the app feel professional
4. **Interview talking point** - "I noticed users would lose data when switching, so I implemented per-campaign storage"
5. **Redux showcase** - Demonstrates understanding of normalized state

The implementation is straightforward and the payoff in UX is massive.

## üí¨ What To Say in an Interview

**Interviewer:** "I see you store data per campaign. Why?"

**You:** "Great question! Initially, I had a single `dashboardData` object that reset on campaign switch. But I realized this meant users lost all accumulated metrics when switching between campaigns - which is frustrating if they're comparing performance. So I refactored to store data keyed by campaign ID. This way, when you switch back to a campaign, you immediately see the data you've already accumulated. It's a better user experience and shows the power of Redux for complex state management."

**Interviewer:** üòç "Excellent architectural thinking!"

---

## üöÄ Final Decision

**Go with Solution 2.** The implementation is clean, the UX is vastly better, and it shows you think about user experience beyond just meeting requirements.
